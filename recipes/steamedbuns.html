<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These steamed buns are yummy Chinese dim sum that can be made with or without meat filling. To make these tasty buns, you'll need a wok equipped with a stainless steel steam plate. After steaming the buns, make sure to remove the lid carefully so condensation doesn't drip onto the buns, as this will produce yellowish blisters on the bun surface. You may use milk in place of the warm water if you wish.</p>
