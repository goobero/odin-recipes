# odin-recipes

This is my first The Odin Project Foundations project.
It's called Recipes. 
The aim is to create a website with recipe pages. We will use practice using skills such as git, navigating the command line, applying knowledge about HTML elements (links, headings, images, etc) and familiarising ourselves with GitHub.
